    <h1>Entertainment Media as a whole</h1>
    <img src="imgs/2019-01-21-INT-entertainment-revenue_1000.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    
    <p>For a long time, entertainment has been consumed mostly in films, radio, and literature.
    Only recently have we really begun to see the emergence of 'Video games' in the scene, and while its still a relatively new emergence,
    it is rapidly overtaking the entirety of the entertainment industry as its ability to tell stories lies not within the confines of 
    the imagination and static images, but now lies with how many systems an author/developer allows their user to toy with.     
    </p>

    <h2> The Emergence of the new generation of entertainment</h2>
    <p>But the entertainment industry that we now know today no longer looks like that of the old.
        It is now littered with Videogames and Videogames are now the largest and fastest growing industry of the "big 3" (Music, Film, Videogames)
        Videogames first really started to come through and be popularized in the 70's, with arcades dominating the market.
        But that wasn't the first "video game" that title is accredited to "Tennis for two" a game made by a physicist in the late 50's, It was a simple pong-like game
        where you would play virtual 2-d tennis. 
    </p>

    <h2>Division within Division</h2>
    <img src="imgs/gaming-history-50-years-timeline-revenue-up2.jpg" id="gamingVisualised">
    <p>Just because the gaming industry is one of the 3 main industries in 
        the entertainment world, doesn't mean there aren't worlds of there own within gaming
        The most notable of the bunch being Mobile, PC, and Console. These three have had a history and a flux
        of there own, and like all thing, they'll change. Arcade used to be as big as PC is now but currently arcades
        are a dying business, the majority are side areas to larger restaurants/bowling alleys.
        So, maybe PC/Console will die, or even the giant that is mobile if VR and such become widespread enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Gaming as a sport?</h2>
    <p>When most people think of gaming, they think of the quintessential couch and console, if they're a little more 
        literate with the subject they might think of a guy sitting on his computer yelling for someone to do better.
        In both of these scenarios the player is playing casually, they might be trying hard to win,
        but no one actually competes in videogames, right?
        <br>
        <br>
        Wrong! E-sports (Electronic Sports) has been a new and growing industry since gamings conception.
        People have been competing in real tournament-style gaming brackets since the 90's,
        the biggest game at that point was most likely Star-Craft, it was gargantuanly popular in china
        even if it wasn't incredibly popular in the west, it had more than enough support from china and 
        surrounding countries to be the biggest game in the later 90's It was so popular that it still has 100k-150k 
        viewers watching championships TODAY! (These are of starcraft2 so not fully the same game 
        but even starcraft1 still gets anywhere from 50-90k viewers for the larger events)
        There definitely were other games in the 90's that were breakouts but none even come
        close to the level of retention that starcraft has been able to keep.
        <br>
        <br>
        A personal favorite Esport of mine is OverWatch, a fast-paced class-based first person shooter.
        It was and should have been the next big e-sport. But sadly due to the studio behind the game -Blizzard Entertainment- 
        having been accused of multiple cases of sexual harassment and discrimination and having been hit with multiple law-suits 
        and what comes with that, the heads of OverWatch, and those who made the game great, quit, most of the team working on
        the game aren't those who started the game, and because of such, the game is a shell of the greatness that it was at one point. 
        But, when the game still had what made it great, one of my personal favorite series ever was the first game of the 2017 OWWC (OverWatch World Cup) 
        where we played Australia. Games at the time were best of 3 where you would rotate game modes after each game. 
        Going into game three we were down 2 nil, losing one more game meant we wouldn't even get past quarterfinals. With the pressure
        building we slowly started playing better, as if the pressure only aided us. Fast forward 2 games, its a 2-2 game 5 scenario, and
        with everything on the line <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/5qRnn9w0iJc?t=7092" > we clutch it.</a> As if the only outcome 
        possible was us winning. We would go on to get 2nd place only losing to South Korea in the finals. 
    </p>

    <h2>Not to knock Casuals</h2>
    <p>Even with Competetive e-sports being a phenomenon the casual scene is still just as big!
        There will always be people who make games that are just meant for the type of people who want to waste
        some time on the couch before heading to bed or out for work. Games like Mario, Minecraft, Pokemon, and the majority
        of mobile games will offer some quick fun for someone who's not looking to use the entirety of their brain so early/late.
        To be completely honest the majortity of the money made by developers are mobile game developers, it's 
        simply a more lucrative well than the rest. It's also the most saturated well of the 3 though, so to get big in mobile gaming
        is incredibly difficult, and requires a lot of planning, marketing, and good advertising, because without it. You're 
        just a tiny, small drop, in an incredibly large ocean.    
    </p>

    <h2>To sum up</h2>
    <p>Gaming is a gargantuan industry that is only getting bigger.
        But it also has something for everyone! If you wan't to know that you're better than someone and want to try to be the best 
        you can play games competetively(and earn some good money while doing it!), or if you're just looking for some quick fun to escape
        your world for a little bit casual games are always there (and are usually cheaper too!). 
        Because of the accessibility and involved nature of video games, they've become a world wide phenomenon,
        and are currently one of the largest growing markets. 
        <br>
        They come from humble beginnings in arcades to now mostly being on your phone. They're the largest of the "big 3" 
        industries within entertainment, aswell as the newest. <br><br>
        <p id="end">They are Videogames.</p>
